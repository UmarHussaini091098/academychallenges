        <h2> A farewell Poem </h2>
        <p>
            Good-bye!—no, do not grieve that it is over, <br>
            The perfect hour; <br>
            That the winged joy, sweet honey-loving rover, <br>
            Flits from the flower. <br>
            Grieve not—it is the law. Love will be flying— <br>
            Yes, love and all. <br>
            Glad was the living—blessed be the dying.
            Let the leaves fall. <br>
        </p>
